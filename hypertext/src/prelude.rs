//! Re-exported items for convenience.

//! This module re-exports all the commonly used items from the crate,
//! so you can use them without having to import them individually. It also
//! re-exports the [`html_elements`] module, and any [framework-specific
//! attribute traits](crate::attributes) that have been enabled, as well as
//! the [`GlobalAttributes`] trait.
