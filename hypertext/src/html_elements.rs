/// This macro should be called from within a module named `html_elements`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// mod html_elements {
///     use hypertext::elements;
///     // Re-export all standard HTML elements
///     pub use hypertext::html_elements::*;
///
///     elements! {
///         /// A custom web component that greets the user.
///         simple_greeting {
///             /// The name of the person to greet.
///             name
///         }
///
///         /// An element representing a coordinate.
///         coordinate {
///             /// The x coordinate.
///             x
///
///             /// The y coordinate.
///             y
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Now, you can use the custom elements like this:
///
/// use hypertext::prelude::*;
///
/// assert_eq!(
///     maud! {
///         simple-greeting name="Alice" {
///             coordinate x=1 y=2 {}
